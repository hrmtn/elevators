My entry to 2018's SQLi Morocco e-coding challenge

I'm just gonna leave this here, maybe It will help someone in the (potential) next challenges  by SQLi Morocco.
I don't really remember how the challenge was presented. I don't recall if we were given other files othar than the test class, I think it was only the test class.
